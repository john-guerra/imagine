title: A Multiplatform Tool for Comparing Users Behavior in Virtual Museum Environments

description: In this project we analyze visitor's behavior in an interactive virtual museum, and how it differentiates depending on the exploration environment. In order to achieve this, a tool with instances for a head-mounted display (Oculus Quest) and a conventional device (Web browser) will be made, using 3D models of archaeological artifacts from the Luis Raúl Rodríguez Lamus Collection - Uniandes.
