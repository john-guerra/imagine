Develop a tool for the Secretary of Government of Bogota, to store and view all the information on the City Council. This system will allow the Secretary to keep a tighter control on the political environment around the new policies coming up in the Council. It will also allow the employees of the Secretariat to save time when answering the requirements of the Council, as it currently takes a big portion of their time.  
This project was codeveloped with Universidad del Rosario's Political Science, Government and International Relationships Dean, Monica Pach√≥n.
