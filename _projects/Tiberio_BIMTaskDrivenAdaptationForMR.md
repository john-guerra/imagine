title: BIM-based mixed reality applications to improve human decision-making during the construction process

description: This PhD thesis project aims to propose mixed reality applications to improve human decision-making during the construction process, in particular during the pre-construction and construction phases. More precisely, we have yet designed 2 applications, one for construction supervision with drones and one for clash review during coordination design review. Currently, we are studying how to improve the preparation of the workers with mixed reality safety training tools. This part of the project is related to the project of Maria Sofia Alvarez Lopez
